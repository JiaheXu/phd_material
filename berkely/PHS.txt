My academic journey has been shaped by a commitment to building accessible, impactful robotics systems and contributing to the research communities I work in. Across my experiences—from CMU AirLab to Katerina’s lab—I have consistently sought environments where engineering excellence is paired with collaboration, clarity, and service.

At CMU’s AirLab, I contributed to object-centric 3D learning pipelines, including modules for perception, bimanual manipulation, and the 3D FlowMatch Actor. I focused on building reproducible data flows, refining training procedures, and improving software reliability for real-world deployment. To support future lab members, I documented these workflows and standardized modules so others could quickly build on them. This was my first experience seeing how much community impact comes from making research tools accessible and easy to adopt.

In Katerina’s lab, I worked on real-world autonomy and multi-sensor perception systems, integrating devices such as Realsense, Azure Kinect, and ZED-X, and developing robust ROS2 nodes for state estimation and navigation. A large part of my role involved helping new students understand the pipeline—debugging hardware, explaining sensor fusion logic, and improving the overall reproducibility of experiments. These experiences reinforced my belief that mentorship is a crucial part of engineering work.

Beyond academic labs, I founded PinocchioAI, a robotics platform that integrates ROS2 modules, multi-sensor perception, and vision-language-action interfaces. Through this project, I have shared open-source code, diagrams, and tutorials that allow students and hobbyists to replicate a full robotics stack using affordable hardware. My goal has been to lower entry barriers to robotics by creating practical, well-documented systems that others can learn from.

I have also contributed to outreach projects that combine engineering with intuitive design, including educational demos and culturally inspired UI systems. These efforts aim to make robotics engaging and approachable to a broader audience.

My work reflects UC Berkeley’s Principles of Community—especially collaboration, inclusion, and knowledge sharing. I hope to contribute to Berkeley’s environment by building open research tools, mentoring peers, and advancing robotics research in ways that strengthen the community around it.
