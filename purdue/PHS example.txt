My development as a robotics researcher has consistently required persistence, resourcefulness, and a willingness to learn independently. Through my work at CMU’s AirLab, in Katerina’s lab, and on my own robotics platform PinocchioAI, I have repeatedly faced the challenge of building systems that work reliably in the real world. Developing object-centric 3D learning pipelines, multi-sensor perception modules, and bimanual manipulation frameworks demanded long iterative cycles, careful debugging, and creative problem-solving when documentation or hardware behaved unpredictably. These experiences taught me to approach research obstacles methodically, remain patient when experiments fail, and continually refine systems until they become stable and reproducible. This mindset has strengthened my ability to persevere through the technical and intellectual challenges of graduate study.

My academic experiences have also prepared me to contribute meaningfully to diverse research communities. At AirLab, I worked to standardize data-processing pipelines and document training workflows to make it easier for new members to contribute. In Katerina’s lab, I frequently helped peers set up sensors, debug ROS2 modules, and understand perception algorithms, gaining experience communicating across different levels of expertise and technical backgrounds. I learned that diverse perspectives—whether theoretical, experimental, or design-oriented—strengthen robotics research by revealing blind spots and inspiring new solutions.

Beyond my lab work, I created PinocchioAI as an open-source platform aimed at lowering entry barriers to robotics. By releasing reproducible ROS2 modules, multi-sensor integration guides, and tutorials, I hoped to support students and practitioners who may not have access to extensive robotics infrastructure. I have also developed public-facing robotics demos designed to make complex autonomy systems more intuitive and engaging for broader audiences.

These experiences reflect my commitment to both technical persistence and community-oriented research. As a graduate student, I hope to contribute to a collaborative academic environment where scholars of different backgrounds and abilities feel supported, respected, and empowered to advance robotics research together.
