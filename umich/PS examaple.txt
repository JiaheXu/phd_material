My academic background in robotics and real-world autonomy has been shaped by diverse cultural and educational experiences across China, Korea, and the United States. Moving between these environments exposed me to different approaches to engineering education, research culture, and collaboration. These experiences taught me to adapt quickly, communicate across perspectives, and appreciate the value of open, inclusive research communities. They also made me aware of how uneven access to robotics resources can be, which shaped my long-term interest in building tools and systems that broaden participation in advanced robotics.

My work in CMU’s AirLab and in Katerina’s lab reinforced this motivation. Developing object-centric 3D learning pipelines, bimanual manipulation frameworks, and multi-sensor perception systems required persistence, independent problem-solving, and a deep interest in bridging theory with deployable systems. I found myself most fulfilled when working on projects that not only advanced technical capability but also improved reproducibility and accessibility for the people around me—such as documenting workflows, improving training pipelines, or helping new students get started with robotics hardware and ROS2 modules.

This commitment later inspired me to build PinocchioAI, an open-source robotics platform that integrates multi-sensor perception, real-world autonomy, and vision-language-action interfaces. My goal was to create a low-cost, easy-to-use system that could help learners without access to large research labs experiment with modern robotics. These experiences clarified that I want my graduate studies to be situated in an environment where engineering innovation, community building, and societal impact are deeply connected.

The University of Michigan embodies these values. Michigan’s strengths in robotics, its emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, and its culture of openness and public impact align strongly with my motivations. I am drawn to Michigan not only for its research excellence, but also for its commitment to building communities where diverse scholars can contribute meaningfully. These values reflect the trajectory of my own academic experiences and motivate my decision to pursue graduate study at Michigan.
